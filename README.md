| [1. Analysis of user behavior in Unnecessary things app](01. Analysis of user behavior in Unnecessary things app)| In application "Unnecessary things" users sell their unnecessary things. The project describes: what events influence the conversion to the target action,  what application usage scenarios stand out,  how time differs between common user events |*Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, event analytics, product metrics,  statistical hypothesis testing, data visualization* |
| [2. Analysis of application business indicators. Ð¡ohort analysis](name)| Despite a huge investment in advertising, ProcrastinatePRO has been losing money over the past few months. The challenge is to figure out why. I did data analysis from app ProcrastinatePRO. Calculated various metrics, used cohort analysis: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, etc. Drew conclusions from the data. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, cohort analysis, unit economy metrics* |
| [3. Evaluation of the results and correctness of the A/B test](name)| The company conducted the A/B test "recommender_system_test". Based on the dataset with user actions, terms of reference and auxiliary datasets, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the A/B test and evaluate the correctness of its implementation. |*Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, testing of statistical hypotheses* |
| [4. Research of the catering market in Moscow](name) | Research of the public catering market in Moscow based on open data in order to find the best location for opening a new establishment. Preparing a presentation for investors | *Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium, data visualization* |
| [5. Analysis of user behavior in a mobile app](name) | It is necessary to understand how users of a mobile application behave, to explore the sales funnel. After that, examine the results of the A/A/B experiment. In this project, I investigated the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, investigated the path of users to purchase. Analyzed the results of the A/B-test of the introduction of new fonts. Compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was properly divided, and then compared with the test group, it was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.| *Pandas, Matplotlib, Math, Numpy, Scipy, Plotly* |
| [6. A/B test. Hypothesis testing for an online store](name) |  It is necessary to prioritize the hypotheses for increasing revenue, prepared together with the marketing department, and analyze the results of the A/B test. Hypotheses were prioritized by ICE and RICE frameworks. Then I analyzed the results of the A / B test, built graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by group, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks for raw and cleaned data. Based on the analysis, I decided that it was not advisable to continue the test. |*Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, testing of statistical hypotheses* |
| [7. Creating custom event dashboard for aggrigator news](name) | It is necessary to make a dashboard showing the interaction of users with cards. In the course of work, I unloaded data from the database,, made a dashboard and a presentation  | *Pandas, Sqlalchemy, Tableau, product metrics* |
| [8. Analysis of tariff plans](name) | Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, it is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and find the optimal tariff. I made a preliminary analysis of the tariffs usage on a sample of customers, analyzed the behavior of customers when using the operator's services and recommended the optimal set of services for users. I did data preprocessing and analysis. I tested the hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions. | *Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Math* | 
| [9. Identification of patterns that determine the success of computer games](name) | It is necessary to conduct data research to identify the most popular platforms, games, genres for subsequent planning of an advertising campaign for 2017. After processing the data, I performed an exploratory data analysis. Considered the dependence of sales on regions, genres, platforms. Conducted an analysis of promising platforms. I determined a portrait of the main buyer by genre, platform and region. Tested hypotheses about the equality of user ratings of genres and several platforms using statistical analysis | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy, descriptive statistics, testing of statistical hypotheses* |
| [10. Banking Data Analysis](name) | It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. And also to answer the question: how do the client's income and the purpose of the loan affect the return on time? I found that defaults depended on income level, marital status, education, and loan goals. Dependence on the number of children could not be identified. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn* |
| [11. Parameters that affect the cost of housing in St. Petersburg](name) | It is necessary to set the parameters, calculate the cost of apartments, to determine the portrait of a typical apartment in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region. On this basis, the customer will create an automatic system to track anomalies and fraudulent activity. During the research, I determined the parameters of various apartments and made recommendations for cutting off anomalous options. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn* |
| [12. Data analysis of Yandex.Music service](name) | It is necessary to compare the musical preferences of Yandex.Music users in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Test three hypotheses. The comparison showed differences and similarities in user preferences. Only one of the three hypotheses was confirmed. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn* |
| [13. Analysis of the database of the service for reading books](name) | The task is to analyze the database. The database contains about books, publishers, authors, and user reviews of books. This data will help formulate a value proposition for a new product. | *PostgreSQL* |
