It is necessary to compare the musical preferences of Yandex.Music users in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

2. On Monday morning, certain genres dominate in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

The comparison showed differences and similarities in user preferences. Only one of the three hypotheses was confirmed.
