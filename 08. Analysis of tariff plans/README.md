## Project - "Analysis of tariff plans"
___
### Project description
The clients of the federal cellular operator "Megaline" are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.

Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, it is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and find the optimal tariff. I made a preliminary analysis of the tariffs usage on a sample of customers, analyzed the behavior of customers when using the operator's services and recommended the optimal set of services for users. I did data preprocessing and analysis. I tested the hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions.
